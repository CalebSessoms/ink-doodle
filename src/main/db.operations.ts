// db.operations.ts - Database operations
// db.operations.ts retained as a marker file.
// All upload-only functions (saveItem, deleteItem) have been removed.
// The file intentionally contains no imports or runtime code to avoid
// accidental local->DB writes while preserving the module path for
// future, explicit re-implementation if desired.
