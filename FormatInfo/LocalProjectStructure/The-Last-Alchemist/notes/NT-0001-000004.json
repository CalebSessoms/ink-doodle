  "content": "Paracelsus' 'Aurum Potabile' manuscript describes catalyst as 'the philosopher's stone that breathes life.' Key quote: 'It must be dissolved in the tears of those who know loss.' Modern translation: Catalyst requires emotional resonance to stabilize. Connects to Elara's orphan trauma – her power stems from unresolved grief.",
